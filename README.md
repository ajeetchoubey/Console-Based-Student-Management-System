# Console-Based-Student-Management-System

It is an simple Console Based Student Management System. It can store, read, update and delete a student's information(Student name, Student Phone Number, Student City). I have used JDBC(Java Database Connectivity), and MySQL Database to Perfrom all the Operations. Database Name is "student_manage"(case sensitive) and the table name is "users"(case-sensitive) and it have 4 columns(sid, sname, sphone and scity). sid is the primary key and auto increment.

You can add extra features in it if you want😁
